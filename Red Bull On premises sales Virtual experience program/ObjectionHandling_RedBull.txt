Hello Lorena, your concern on Red bull in your bar is completely understandable. 
Red bull might be quite expensive compared to other beverages available in your bar but unlike other drinks, red bull gives a energy quotient to the consumer which is not available in any other drinks. 
So a customer who has already tasted red bull knows that it is totally different from the other drinks he has tasted and will come for it for this unique experience. 
Having Red bull in your bar will uplift the bar's image just because of the brand value red bull has. 
Moreover, energy drinks are one of the fastest growing product categories and red bull is one among the top companies having this product that too with wide product assortment. 

And your concern on customers not asking for red bull in your bar is because of the underlying fact that the marketing initiatives of red bull in your bar and the product assortments are relatively lesser. On analyzing the data, it is seen that the bars having sugar free and yellow edition of red bull have significantly higher sales than the bars not having them. Also bars which have Digital screens featuring red bull and having red bull in their menu card have significantly higher sales than the bars not having them. So it is required for you to include the said versions of red bull and the marketing initiatives which in turn will up lift the sales of red bull than other products as we have seen the same in other bars and i would suggest the same.
